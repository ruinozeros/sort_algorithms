# sort algorithms

## selection sort 
The algorithm finds the minimum value, swaps it with the value in the first position, and repeats these steps for the remainder of the list. It does no more than n swaps, and thus is useful where swapping is very expensive. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Selection_sort)
